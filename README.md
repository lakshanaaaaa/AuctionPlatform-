# AuctionPlatform-
The Online Auction Platform is a full-stack web application designed to host real-time, time-based auctions for rare and historically significant items. Inspired by traditional auction systems, the platform enables registered users to participate in ongoing auctions, place competitive bids, and win items based on the highest bid when the countdown timer ends.
Targeted towards collectors and enthusiasts, the platform focuses on the sale of niche items such as monarch-era jewels, ancient coins, rare manuscripts, and heritage artworks. To ensure transparency and authenticity, a dedicated research and verification team—comprising subject matter experts from history, archaeology, numismatics, and fine art—is integrated into the platform’s operations.
Developed using React (with Vite) and styled with Tailwind CSS, the frontend offers a fast, modern, and responsive user interface. The backend is powered by Firebase, providing secure authentication, real-time database interactions, scalable storage, hosting, and serverless functions.
To further enhance user engagement in future, the platform features an AI-powered chatbot assistant that offers onboarding guidance, helps navigate auctions, and provides real-time assistance throughout the user journey.
